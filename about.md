# About

Vimperator was the first project from Vimperator labs and initially written by
Martin Stubenschrott.
Being a Vim-lover,
he finally realized that he spent more and more time browsing the Web instead
of writing code in his favorite editor.
The remedy this situation,
he looked into extending his favorite browser Firefox and Vimperator was born.

## History

First coding of Vimperator has started in 2006,
with the first public release in 2007.
Most development related discussions quickly emerged on our
IRC channel #vimperator, where new ideas were born, tested and discussed.

In 2008, Vimperator's ideas really took off and lots of new contributors
started improving Vimperator.
Martin also decided to investigate a possible port of Vimperator to other
Mozilla applications, like Thunderbird.
Especially Doug Kearns and Kris Maglione helped in designing a library -
called liberator - which provides a framework to create Vim-like applications.
Muttator and Xulmus followed soon and currently a vivid community with many
hackers is working on the projects.

In 2010, a huge redesign started to from the basis of what would become
Vimperator 3.0 and later versions.
Due to some controversy between the main developers,
Vimperator split into the main 3.0 branch which incorporates the new
[streamlined design guidlines](http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/wiki/Vimperator3DesignGoals)
and Pentadactyl which focuses on feature-ladden Vim compatibility.

In 2011, the vimperator labs developers decided to focus again on Vimperator
and Muttator and dropped Xulmus (the "Vimperator for Music") from the repository
as there was no active maintainer and because of the general quality of the
port.
